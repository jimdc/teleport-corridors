      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">1) What the app measures</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          The core data is subway travel time between areas. From that we derive:
          <b>centrality</b> (how connected a place is to everything else) and <b>corridors</b> (trips that look far by distance
          but are fast by transit).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">2) Why census tracts are not enough</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          Tracts are administrative boundaries, not lived neighborhoods. They often bundle multiple places with different transit
          access. This app adds a sub-tract layer to capture variation within those boundaries.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">3) Micro-units (sub-tract substrate)</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          We create a small grid of micro-units, then redistribute tract-level values into those cells by area overlap. This gives
          a finer surface without inventing new data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">4) Derived neighborhoods</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          Micro-units are grouped into smaller regions using a deterministic partition: each cell is assigned to its nearest subway
          station, then merged into station-based regions. These are smaller than tracts and align better with transit behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">5) Naming (StreetEasy-style, no invention)</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          We prefer established neighborhood names when an authoritative polygon set is available. If not, we fall back to the
          nearest subway station name and use compound names when overlaps are ambiguous. When multiple regions share the same
          label, we add a short station suffix (or a compact directional tag). We avoid inventing new trendy names.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">6) Hub-first UI cues</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          Hubs are rendered as first-class objects (rings + subtle halos). Labels are intentionally sparse: the map stays clean and
          the sidebar acts as the “label sink” for spokes, rankings, and detail.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-card">
        <h2 class="card-title">7) Cartogram</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
          Cartogram mode rescales neighborhood <b>area</b> to encode the selected “Resize by” metric. Geographic mode leaves
          geometry untouched (Resize by is ignored unless Cartogram is active). Available metrics include <b>Population</b> and
          <b>Housing units</b> from the NYC NTA Housing Tenure layer, plus <b>Jobs</b> from LODES WAC (aggregated to NTA2020).
          Cartograms keep the same hover/label behavior but trade geographic fidelity for scale clarity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="card-title">8) Limitations</h2>
        <ul class="page-list">
          <li>Derived boundaries are a model of transit access, not official borders.</li>
          <li>Name confidence varies; some regions are only loosely tied to a recognized label.</li>
          <li>Subway schedules change; the app uses a snapshot of service patterns.</li>
          <li>Cartograms prioritize metric scale over exact geometry.</li>
        </ul>
